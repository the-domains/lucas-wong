_**Destiny**_is an[online-only][0][first-person shooter][1][video game][2]developed by[Bungie][3]and published by[Activision][4]. It was released on September 9, 2014, for the[PlayStation 3][5],[PlayStation 4][6],[Xbox 360][7], and[Xbox One][8]consoles._Destiny_marked Bungie's first new console franchise since the_[Halo][9]_series, and it is the first game in a ten-year agreement between Bungie and Activision. Set in a["mythic science fiction"][10]world, the game features a multiplayer "shared-world" environment with elements of[role-playing][11]games. Activities in_Destiny_are divided among[player versus environment][12](PvE) and[player versus player][13](PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player "[strikes][14]" and six-player[raids][15]. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each planet and features public events. PvP features[deathmatch][16]game modes, as well as objective-based modes.

Players take on the role of a Guardian, defenders of Earth's last safe city, simply called The Last City, as they wield a power called Light to protect the City from different alien races. The Guardians are tasked with reviving a celestial being called the Traveler, while journeying to different planets to investigate and destroy the alien threats before humanity is completely wiped out. Since launch, Bungie has released three[expansion packs][17]furthering the story, adding new content and missions, and new PvP modes. Year One of_Destiny_featured two expansions,_The Dark Below_in December 2014 and_House of Wolves_in May 2015\. A third, larger expansion,_[The Taken King][18]_, was released in September 2015 and marked the beginning of Year Two, changing much of the core gameplay. In December 2015, Bungie announced that they have shifted to an event-based model: limited-time events will happen more often instead of releasing a new expansion every few months.
